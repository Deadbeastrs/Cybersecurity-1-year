How to run example:

python3 decrypt.py texts/1.txt pt texts/result.txt # Portuguese

python3 decrypt.py texts/5.txt eng texts/result.txt # English

---------------

This program cracks a vigenere cipther encrypted text with no known key.
It discovers the original key and the decrypted text.
For this we use 3 main functions:
    - FindKeyLength
    - FindKey
    - Decrypt

The FindKeyLength function compares the encrypted text with itself multiple times, removing each time the first letter.
These comparisons allow us to find the same letters in both texts in the same position, and a pattern will start to form.
There is going to be a high number of coincidences that are the same distance apart, this is the aproximate key length.

The FindKey divides the encrypted text in groups (that are as many as the key length) and then, for each group, the most common letter is found.
This most common lettter in the english dictionary is E, and for that reason, the most common letter in each group is probably an E.
We use the matrix to find the correspondent row to the column E and with the most common letter in each group, find the real key.
For the portuguese language the same applies, but the most common letter is an A, so the most common letters correspond to the key.

The Decrypt method uses the found key and the encrypted text to decrypt it.
